The workflow will go as follows

[recruiter]
1.   recruiter goes to 'initiate_meeting' screen
2.   recruiter enters recruiter_email, hiring_manager_email, candidate_email 
     along with
     various metadata like job_title, description_text, etc.
2b.  an email is sent to the recruiter, recruiter clicks a link 
     where he confirms the request on confirmation_page

[candidate]
3.   an email is sent to candidate_email and hiring_manager_email
4.   candidate receives a link to their email, clicks on link
5.   candidate enters timeframe_chunk, clicks "Add timeframe"
6.   candidate is redirected to their "Current Availability" in a view
7.   candidate can click "Delete Timeframe" next to any timeframe
8.   candidate can always click "Add More Availability" taking them to a view
9.   on this view, candidate can enter another timeframe_chunk, like in (5)
9b.  this view must additionally check that timeframes do not overlap
     ** (actually, this is not strictly required)

[hiring_manager]
10.  as soon as any timeframe_chunk is given by a user, hiring_manager's 
     email_link will send them to a page where they can select an
     interview_timeframe
11.  hiring_manager will click "Submit Interview Request"
12.  the interview_timeframe is confirmed to be in an available timeframe_chunk
13.  an email is sent to the candidate saying "hiring_manager has submitted
     an interview request, click here to confirm availability"

[candidate]
14.  can click through to the confirm_interview_request page, and either accept
     or reject the request
15.  if the candidate attempts to visit any timeframe_chunk pages while an
     interview_request has been made, they are redirected to the 
     confirm_interview_request page
16.  if the interviewee confirms, an email is sent to all three interested
     parties
